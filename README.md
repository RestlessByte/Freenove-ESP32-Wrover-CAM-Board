# 🚀 Project for Using ESP32 CAM and SR602 Motion Sensor 🚀

This project uses the ESP32 CAM board and SR602 motion sensor. Everything is connected via the Telegram API. In the file [/index/config.h], in the TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN field, enter the token of the chat bot obtained from the [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) chat bot. In the TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID field, enter the chat ID where notifications and photos from the camera will be sent. In the WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD fields, enter the network name and password. And that's it! 🎉

**Note:** The code can only be used with mention of this developer. 📝

**Important:** SR602 is connected strictly to pin 14 on the board.

Thank you for using our project! 😊
